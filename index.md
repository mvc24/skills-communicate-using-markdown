# Hello, I'm a H1 Header.
## Hello, I'm a H2 header. 
#### I'm a H4 header, I know I skipped the h3. 
###### and I'm a h6, something I probably won't ever use, but who knows.

I'm going to add a picture now. 
![An image of a slightly grumpy owl with a cup of coffee](https://github.com/mvc24/skills-communicate-using-markdown/assets/139975604/9877bdc6-43e3-4ab0-9732-a4a82d875462)

And now some code:

``` javascript
let variable = 'This is bananas!';
```
And now a task list, how exciting. Just like the piece I'm listening to right now.

- [ ] Check the composer of the piece.
- [ ] Check if the bagpipes are fun.
- [ ] Check if using accents as any kind of quotation marks seems like heresy.
- [ ] Check if you want to go to bed soon.

I think these are enough tasks.
